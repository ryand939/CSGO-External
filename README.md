# CSGO-External
This is a project I made for my ICS4U ISP.
I manually grab each offset individually so they will likely need to be updated if this cheat is ever used again.
This is my first somewhat complete video game cheat so I am not entirely sure if it bypasses VAC especially because I am using a public memory class.

## Features
- Bunnyhop (Perfect and legit mode)
- Triggerbot (Optional ignore teammates)
- Enemy glow through walls
- Colour picker sub-menu
- Player chams (team=blue, enemy=red)
- Reveal all hidden enemies on radar
- Remove flashbang blinding effect
- Modify FOV
